{"tasks":{"Lab":{"difficulty":"Hard","day_needed":[7,14]},"Quiz":{"difficulty":"Easy","day_needed":[2,5]}},"contains_schedule":false,"topic":["Distributed Systems","Asynchronous programming"],"thought":"For this distributed systems course, I recommend starting labs immediately upon assignment release, dedicating 2-3 weeks of consistent work per lab. Begin with requirements analysis (1-2 days), move to design (3-7 days), implementation (7-14 days), and reserve the last 2-3 days before deadline for testing and documentation. This timeline acknowledges the complexity of distributed systems implementation and the significant weight of labs (75% of your grade). For quizzes (25% of grade), since they're available online for multiple days, start preparing at least 3-4 days before the quiz closing date, reviewing lecture materials and class discussions thoroughly to ensure comprehension of technical concepts."}
